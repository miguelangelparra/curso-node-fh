500 Internal Server Error
A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.[63]
501 Not Implemented
The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfil the request. Usually this implies future availability (e.g., a new feature of a web-service API).[64]
502 Bad Gateway
The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.[65]
503 Service Unavailable
The server cannot handle the request (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance). Generally, this is a temporary state.[66]
